# MicroprocessorLab-Course-Project
Course Project for PH435 - Microprocessor Lab by Karthik Dasigi and Parth Sastry

The actual code section that generates our TRNGs, is present within the FullMethod.ino file, within a function called getTrueRotatedRandomByte().
The rest of the code is just to create bitmaps to visualise the randomness of the bits generated, so that we could present them in the report. The report itself is attached as  ProjectReport.pdf.
